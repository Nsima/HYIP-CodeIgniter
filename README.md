# HYIP-CodeIgniter
A simple HYIP in CodeIgniter

>BOREDOM CAUSED THIS.

I got bored and decided to see how fast I could build a bit complicated web app with a framework. There are a lot of High Yield Investment Programmes currently on the web, this project is not modelled after any one.

## Day 1 -  I downloaded a free dashboard template design and decided to adjust to meet my needs
_DashTreme Admin Template_

## Day 2 - Downloaded the CodeIgniter 3.1.1 Framework and broke the template into the framework
_CodeIgniter 3.1.1_

>CodeIgniter 3 does not support most PHP current practices. CodeIgniter 4 or Laravel would have been a better option. But like I said earlier, BOREDOM.

## Day 3 - Plan the workflow of the project.
_I decided to follow the workflow of a popular MMM, I then realized, that MMM was a peer to peer High Yield Investment Program, so this part of the work will continue changing till the end of this project_

- An admin end
- A user end

## Day 4 - (A continuation of Day 3)

- I had to rename the 'application' folder to 'public' (Just because I can)

## Day 5 - 9 (Working on the functionality)

- User registeration
- Referral System
- User buys "coin"
- User waits for coin to yeild
- User sells coin to another user (_and the cycle continues_)
